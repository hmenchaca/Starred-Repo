# Starred Repos Test Ap

This project was created as a part of a test.

## Purpose

The purpose of the application was to have a list of the last week more trending repos and see them in a list(description , name , url , owner, number of stars).

Also the user needs to have the ability to filter by programming language and starred/vote for those repos.
